During the countless hours of problem-solving and googling that programming demands, I came across some personal portfolios that inspired this notes section ([here](https://hann.fyi/blog) [are](https://brianlovin.com/writing) [a](https://rmurphey.com/) [few](https://nataly.dev/notes)).  
&nbsp;

So I decided to include this section on my own website, mainly as a resource for my own learning and to keep track of problems I encounter and their respective solutions, and maybe with the added bonus of sharing those solutions with anyone else who might need them.
