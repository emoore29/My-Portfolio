I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in late 2022 when I somewhat spontaneously decided it was time to learn programming. I'd often thought about it, but maybe it took getting to my late 20s to realise that life doesn't wait around for you to do these things.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
Before starting my programming journey, I worked as an editor and transcriptionist. Before that, I had studied to be a vet. The reasons I went into those fields are still part of me: I love reading and writing, and I love animals. But one of the main things I learned in my 20s is that you can have a passion for something, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will make a good career for you. I don't think anybody should ever feel stuck in life, or forced into a box and then never allowed to leave. It's okay to say, "No, this isn't working for me anymore", and try something different.  
&nbsp;

So after completing a few freeCodeCamp's web development certifications, I realised that I wanted to continue my learning journey, and started studying React and building some of my first full websites for family and friends.
