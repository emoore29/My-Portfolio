# [My Portfolio](https://emmamoore.vercel.app/)

Originally adapted from [this Next.js starter tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) for learning Next.js basics, and deployed using Vercel. 

I frequently revisit this as I improve my knowledge about web development best practices, particularly UI/UX, accessibility, and DRY code. Also to add new projects that are suitable for a portfolio. As a result don't be surprised if it changes dramatically from month to month depending on how active I've been. Hopefully eventually I will settle on a design I don't hate.
