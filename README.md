# [My Portfolio](https://emmamoore.vercel.app/)

I originally adapted this from [this Next.js starter tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to learn the Next.js basics. This was before the App Router was implemented, so I've used the Pages Router. The site is deployed with Vercel.

When I first created this, I was still quite new to web development and experimenting with different frameworks. I used Next.js because it seemed like a natural progression after learning React, being one of the most popular frameworks recommended by React. I also used CSS modules because I wanted to see if it would help me organise my CSS. I'm not sure I have enough experience with other CSS structures to comment on my preference, but with proper organisation CSS modules seems helpful - I had to go back and improve my organisation after learning more about the purpose of CSS modules.

Having said that, if I were to go back (one day I might), I would probably use Jekyll for a simpler and more lightweight codebase, since most of the above now seems like overkill for the purpose of this website.
