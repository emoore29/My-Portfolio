# [My Website](https://emmamoore.vercel.app/)

I originally adapted this from [this Next.js starter tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to learn Next.js basics. The site is deployed with Vercel.

I frequently revisit this as I improve my knowledge about web development best practices, particularly UI/UX, accessibility, and DRY code. As a result, it's a constant work in progress.
